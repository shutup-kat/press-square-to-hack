	The proposed ChatGPT cybersecurity plugin will provide the following key functionalities:
Vulnerability Profile Creation: The plugin will allow users to feed the results from vulnerability scans, along with cybersecurity contexts and other relevant information, to create a comprehensive security profile for their institution.
Report Generation: The plugin will generate detailed reports encompassing vulnerability findings, risk assessments, and recommended remediation actions. These reports will serve as valuable references for prioritizing and planning remediation efforts.
Remediation Workflow: The plugin will assist users in creating task-based remediation workflows, breaking down the remediation process into actionable task items. This workflow will streamline and organize the remediation efforts, enhancing efficiency and tracking progress.
Custom Environment Explanations: The plugin will provide clear explanations on the nature, impact, and relevance of vulnerabilities to the user's custom environment. It will contextualize vulnerabilities, making it easier for users to understand the "what," "why," and "how" aspects of the vulnerabilities in their specific context.
User Experience Customization: The plugin will offer the ability to tailor the output and level of detail based on the user's experience level and requirements. Users can customize the complexity and depth of the information presented to match their expertise and preferences.
Results Archiving*: The plugin will enable users to save previously generated results*, allowing them to revisit and reassess the status of vulnerabilities after remediation steps have been taken. This feature will facilitate continuous monitoring and reassessment of the security posture over time.
Specifics of these features and their implementations will be further discussed as the project progresses. When OpenAI decides to fund this project, all information will become available and articulated to the best of my ability. For the purpose of simplicity, I have just provided a brief overview of the features. However I have already put in a significant amount of energy towards envisioning realistic measures that need to be taken to bring this to life.

5. Available Resources:
	The project will be undertaken by a dedicated developer with a background in cybersecurity, which is me. If funding allows, additional developers will be recruited and compensate for their efforts towards creating this plugin. In the case that additional developers are brought on, OpenAI will be made aware prior to their onboarding via preferred form of contact. The developer will seek funding from OpenAI to support the development, testing, and deployment of the ChatGPT cybersecurity plugin.

6. Project Timeline:
	Upon securing funding from OpenAI, a detailed project timeline will be established.
